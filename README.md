# CosPlace Extended: Insights into Architectural and Feature Choices for Visual Geo-localization
SThis project is built upon the work of [CosPlace](https://github.com/gmberton/CosPlace.git), originally created by [Gabriele Berton].

##Abstract 
In this paper, we extend the CosPlace framework for Visual Geo-localization (VG), allowing for the construc- tion, training, and evaluation of various architectures. Our objective is to gain insights into the effectiveness of specific features and design choices in a VG pipeline, establishing a systematic evaluation protocol for method comparison. Leveraging our framework, we experiment extensively to benchmark and optimize parameters, while evaluating the impact of engineering techniques on model performance.
